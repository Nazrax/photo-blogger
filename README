Photo Blogger

My wife and I take lots of pictures and we wanted some way to share
our pictures with our friends. Unfortunately, nothing available really
met our needs. We wanted a blog, not a simple gallery, but most of the
blogs out there are designed for lots of text and a picture or two,
not for a little text with lots of pictures. PHP Blogger
(www.phpblogger.com) came the closest, but it still didn't meet our
needs. So, I decided to write my own.

Goals:
- Easy to add and manage posts
- Attractive slideshow-style image display
- S3 storage support
- A spam-proof (or at least resistant) comment system


Dependencies:
- rspec-rails
- RedCloth
- ImageScience


Configuration:
Find all of the foo.conf.sample files, copy them to foo.conf, and
alter as needed; then run the DB migrations.
